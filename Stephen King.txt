STRAWBERRY SPRING

Springheel Jack.

I saw those two words in the paper this morning and my God, how they take me back. All that was eight years ago, almost to the day. Once, while it was going on, I saw myself on nationwide TV - the Walter Cronkite Report. Just a hurrying face in the general background behind the reporter, but my folks picked me out right away. They called long-distance. My dad wanted my analysis of the situation; he was all bluff and hearty and man-to-man. My mother just wanted me to come home. But I didn't want to come home. I was enchanted.

Enchanted by that dark and mist-blown strawberry spring, and by the shadow of violent death that walked through it on those nights eight years ago. The shadow of Springheel Jack.

In New England they call it a strawberry spring. No one knows why; it's just a phrase the old-timers use. They say it happens once every eight or ten years. What happened at New Sharon Teachers' College that particular strawberry spring. . . there may be a cycle for that, too, but if anyone has figured it out, they've never said.

At New Sharon, the strawberry spring began on 16 March 1968. The coldest winter in twenty years broke on that day. It rained and you could smell the sea twenty miles west of the beaches. The snow, which had been thirty-five inches deep in places, began to melt and the campus walks ran with slush. The Winter Carnival snow sculptures, which had been kept sharp and clear-cut for two months by the sub-zero temperatures, at last began to sag and slouch. The caricature of Lyndon Johnson in front of the Tep fraternity house cried melted tears. The dove in front of Prashner Hall lost its frozen feathers and its plywood skeleton showed sadly through in places.

And when night came the fog came with it, moving silent and white along the narrow college avenues and thoroughfares. The pines on the wall poked through it like counting fingers and it drifted, slow as cigarette smoke, under the little bridge down by the Civil War cannons. It made things seem out of joint, strange, magical. The unwary traveller would step out of the juke-thumping, brightly lit confusion of the Grinder, expecting the hard clear starriness of winter to clutch him . . . and instead he would suddenly find himself in a silent, muffled world of white drifting fog, the only sound his own footsteps and the soft drip of water from the ancient gutters. You half expected to see Gollum or Frodo and Sam go hurrying past, or to turn and see that the Grinder was gone, vanished, replaced by a foggy panorama of moors and yew trees and perhaps a Druid-circle or a sparkling fairy ring.

The jukebox played 'Love Is Blue' that year. It played 'Hey, Jude' endlessly, endlessly. It played 'Scarborough Fair.

And at ten minutes after eleven on that night a junior named John Dancey on his way back to his dormitory began screaming into the fog, dropping books on and between the sprawled legs of the dead girl lying in a shadowy corner of the Animal Sciences parking lot, her throat cut from ear to ear but her eyes open and almost seeming to sparkle as if she had just successfully pulled off the funniest joke of her young life - Dancey, an education major and a speech minor, screamed and screamed and screamed.

The next day was overcast and sullen, and we went to classes with questions eager in our mouths - who? why? when do you think they'll get him? And always the final thrilled question: Did you know her? Did you know her?

Yes, I had an art class with her.

Yes, one of my room-mate 's friends dated her last term.

Yes, she asked me for a light once in the Grinder. She was at the next table.

Yes, Yes, I

Yes. . . yes. . . oh yes, I

We all knew her. Her name was Gale Cerman (pronounced Kerr-man), and she was an art major. She wore granny glasses and had a good figure. She was well liked but her room-mates had hated her. She had never gone out much even though she was one of the most promiscuous girls on campus. She was ugly but cute. She had been a vivacious girl who talked little and smiled seldom. She had been pregnant and she had had leukemia. She was a lesbian who had been murdered by her boy-friend. It was strawberry spring, and on the morning of 17 March we all knew Gale Cerman.

Half a dozen State Police cars crawled on to the campus, most of them parked in front of Judith Franklin Hall, where the Cerman girl had lived. On my way past there to my ten o clock class I was asked to show my student ID. I was clever. I showed him the one without the fangs.

'Do you carry a knife?' the policeman asked cunningly.

'Is it about Gale Cerman?' I asked, after I told him that the most lethal thing on my person was a rabbit's-foot key chain.

'What makes you ask?' He pounced.

I was five minutes late to class.

It was strawberry spring and no one walked by themselves through the half-academical, half-fantastical campus that night. The fog had come again, smelling of the sea, quiet and deep.

Around nine o'clock my room-mate burst into our room, where I had been busting my brains on a Milton essay since seven. 'They caught him,' he said. 'I heard it over at the Grinder.'

'From who?'

'I don't know. Some guy. Her boy4riend did it. His name is Carl Amalara.'

I settled back, relieved and disappointed. With a name like that it had to be true. A lethal and sordid little crime of passion.

'Okay,' I said. 'That's good.'

He left the room to spread the news down the hall. I reread my Milton essay, couldn't figure out what I had been trying to say, tore it up and started again.

It was in the papers the next day. There was an incongruously neat picture of Amalara - probably a high-school graduation picture - and it showed a rather sad-looking boy with an olive complexion and dark eyes and pockmarks on his nose. The boy had not confessed yet, but the evidence against him was strong. He and Gale Cerman had argued a great deal in the last month or so, and had broken up the week before. Amalara's roomie said he had been 'despondent'. In a footlocker under his bed, police had found a seven-inch hunting knife from L. L. Bean's and a picture of the girl that had apparently been cut up with a pair of shears.

Beside Amalara's picture was one of Gale Cerman. It blurrily showed a dog, a peeling lawn flamingo, and a rather mousy blonde girl wearing spectacles. An uncomfortable smile had turned her lips up and her eyes were squinted. One hand was on the dog's head. It was true then. It had to be true.

The fog came again that night, not on little cat's feet but in an improper silent sprawl. I walked that night. I had a headache and I walked for air, smelling the wet, misty smell of the spring that was slowly wiping away the reluctant snow, leaving lifeless patches of last year's grass bare and uncovered, like the head of a sighing old grandmother.

For me, that was one of the most beautiful nights I can remember. The people I passed under the haloed streetlights were murmuring shadows, and all of them seemed to be lovers, walking with hands and eyes linked. The melting snow dripped and ran, dripped and ran, and from every dark storm drain the sound of the sea drifted up, a dark winter sea now strongly ebbing.

I walked until nearly midnight, until I was thoroughly mildewed, and I passed many shadows, heard many footfalls clicking dreamily off down the winding paths. Who is to say that one of those shadows was not the man or the thing that came to be known as Springheel Jack? Not I, for I passed many shadows but in the fog I saw no faces.

The next morning the clamour in the hall woke me. I blundered out to see who had been drafted, combing my hair with both hands and running the fuzzy caterpillar that had craftily replaced my tongue across the dry roof of my mouth.

'He got another one,' someone said to me, his face pallid with excitement. 'They had to let him go.'

'Who go?'

'Amalara!' someone else said gleefully. 'He was sitting in jail when it happened.

When what happened?' I asked patiently. Sooner or later I would get it. I was sure of that.

'The guy killed somebody else last night. And now they're hunting all over for it.'

'For what?'

The pallid face wavered in front of me again. 'Her head. Whoever killed her took her head with him.'

New Sharon isn't a big school now, and was even smaller then - the kind of institution the public relations people chummily refer to as a 'community college'. And it really was like a small community, at least in those days; between you and your friends, you probably had at least a nodding acquaintance with everybody else and their friends. Gale

Cerman had been the type of girl you just nodded to, thinking vaguely that you had seen her around.

We all knew Ann Bray. She had been the first runner-up in the Miss New England pageant the year before, her talent performance consisting of twirling a flaming baton to the tune of 'Hey, Look Me Over'. She was brainy, too; until the time of her death she had been editor of the school newspaper (a once-weekly rag with a lot of political cartoons and bombastic letters), a member of the student dramatics society, and president of the National Service Sorority, New Sharon Branch. In the hot, fierce bubblings of my freshman youth I had submitted a column idea to the paper and asked for a date - turned down on both counts.

And now she was dead. . . worse than dead.

I walked to my afternoon classes like everyone else, nodding to people I knew and saying hi with a little more force than usual, as if that would make up for the close way I studied their faces. Which was the same way they were studying mine. There was someone dark among us, as dark as the paths which twisted across the mall or wound among the hundred-year-old oaks on the quad in back of the gymnasium. As dark as the hulking Civil War cannons seen through a drifting membrane of fog. We looked into each other's faces and tried to read the darkness behind one of them.

This time the police arrested no one. The blue beetles patrolled the campus ceaselessly on the foggy spring nights of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth, and spotlights stabbed in to dark nooks and crannies with erratic eagerness. The administration imposed a mandatory nine o'clock curfew. A foolhardy couple discovered necking in the landscaped bushes north of the Tate Alumni Building were taken to the New Sharon police station and grilled unmercifully for three hours.

There was a hysterical false alarm on the twentieth when a boy was found unconscious in the same parking lot where the body of Gale Cerman had been found. A gibbering campus cop loaded him into the back of his cruiser and put a map of the county over his face without bothering to hunt for a pulse and started towards the local hospital, siren wailing across the deserted campus like a seminar of banshees.

Halfway there the corpse in the back seat had risen and asked hollowly, 'Where the hell am I?' The cop shrieked and ran off the road. The corpse turned out to be an undergrad named Donald Morris who had been in bed the last two days with a pretty lively case of flu - was it Asian last year? I can't remember. Anyway, he fainted in the parking lot on his way to the Grinder for a bowl of soup and some toast.

The days continued warm and overcast. People clustered in small groups that had a tendency to break up and re-form with surprising speed. Looking at the same set of faces for too long gave you funny ideas about some of them. And the speed with which rumours swept from one end of the campus to the other began to approach the speed of light; a well-liked history professor had been overheard laughing and weeping down by the small bridge; Gale Cerman had left a cryptic two-word message written in her own blood on the blacktop of the Animal Sciences parking lot; both murders were actually political crimes, ritual murders that had been performed by an offshoot of the SDS to protest the war. This was really laughable. The New Sharon SDS had seven members. One fair-sized offshoot would have bankrupted the whole organization. This fact brought an even more sinister embellishment from the campus rightwingers: outside agitators. So during those queer, warm days we all kept our eyes peeled for them.

The press, always fickle, ignored the strong resemblance our murderer bore to Jack the Ripper and dug further back - all the way to 1819. Ann Bray had been found on a soggy path of ground some twelve feet from the nearest sidewalk, and yet there were no footprints, not even her own. An enterprising New Hampshire newsman with a passion for the arcane christened the killer Springheel Jack, after the infamous Dr John Hawkins of Bristol, who did five of his wives to death with odd pharmaceutical knick-knacks. And the name, probably because of that soggy yet unmarked ground, stuck.

On the twenty-first it rained again, and the mall and quadrangle became quagmires. The police announced that they were salting plainclothes detectives, men and women, about, and took half the police cars off duty.

The campus newspaper published a strongly indignant, if slightly incoherent, editorial protesting this. The upshot of it seemed to be that, with all sorts of cops masquerading as students, it would be impossible to tell a real outside agitator from a false one.

Twilight came and the fog with it, drifting up the tree-lined avenues slowly, almost thoughtfully, blotting out the buildings one by one. It was soft, insubstantial stuff, but somehow implacable and frightening. Springheel Jack was a man, no one seemed to doubt that, but the fog was his accomplice and it was female. . . or so it seemed to me. If was as if our little school was caught between them, squeezed in some crazy lover's embrace, part of a marriage that had been consummated in blood. I sat and smoked and watched the lights come on in the growing darkness and wondered if it was all over. My room-mate came in and shut the door quietly behind him.

'It's going to snow soon,' he said.

I turned around and looked at him. 'Does the radio say that?'

'No,' he said. 'Who needs a weatherman? Have you ever heard of strawberry spring?'

'Maybe,' I said. 'A long time ago. Something grandmothers talk about, isn't it?'

He stood beside me, looking out at the creeping dark.

'Strawberry spring is like Indian summer,' he said, 'only much more rare. You get a good Indian summer in this part of the country once every two or three years. A spell of weather like we've been having is supposed to come only every eight or ten. It's a false spring, a lying spring, like Indian summer is a false summer. My own grandmother used to say strawberry spring means the worst norther of the winter is still on the way - and the longer this lasts, the harder the storm.

'Folk tales,' I said. 'Never believe a word.' I looked at him. But I'm nervous. Are you?'

He smiled benevolently and stole one of my cigarettes from the open pack on the window ledge. 'I suspect everyone but me. and thee,' he said, and then the smile faded a little. 'And sometimes I wonder about thee. Want to go over to the Union and shoot some eight-ball? I'll spot you ten.'

'Trig prelim next week. I'm going to settle down with a magic marker and a hot pile of notes.'

For a long time after he was gone, I could only look out the window. And even after I had opened my book and started in, part of me was still out there, walking in the shadows where something dark was now in charge.

That night Adelle Parkins was killed. Six police cars and seventeen collegiate-looking plain clothes men (eight of them were women imported all the way from Boston) patrolled the campus. But Springheel Jack killed her just the same, going unerringly for one of our own. The false spring, the lying spring, aided and abetted him - he killed her and left her propped behind the wheel of her 1964 Dodge to be found the next morning and they found part of her in the back seat and part of her in the trunk. And written in blood on the windshield - this time fact instead of rumour - were two words: HA! HA!

The campus went slightly mad after that; all of us and none of us had known Adelle Parkins. She was one of those nameless, harried women who worked the break-back shift in the Grinder from six to eleven at night, facing hordes of hamburger-happy students on study break from the library across the way. She must have had it relatively easy those last three foggy nights of her life; the curfew was 'being rigidly observed, and after nine the Grinder's only patrons were hungry cops and happy janitors - the empty buildings had improved their habitual bad temper considerably.

There is little left to tell. The police, as prone to hysteria as any of us and driven against the wall, arrested an innocuous homosexual sociology graduate student named Hanson Gray, who claimed he 'could not remember' where he had spent several of the lethal evenings. They charged him, arraigned him, and let him go to scamper hurriedly back to his native New Hampshire town after the last unspeakable night of strawberry spring when Marsha Curran was slaughtered on the mall.

Why she had been out and alone is forever beyond knowing - she was a fat, sadly pretty thing who lived in an apartment in town with three other girls. She had slipped on campus as silently and as easily as Springheel Jack himself. What brought her? Perhaps her need was as deep and as ungovernable as her killer's, and just as far beyond understanding. Maybe a need for one desperate and passionate romance with the warm night, the warm fog, the smell of the sea, and the cold knife.

That was on the twenty-third. On the twenty-fourth the president of the college announced that spring break would be moved up a week, and we scattered, not joyfully but like frightened sheep before a storm, leaving the campus empty and haunted by the police and one dark spectre.

I had my own car on campus, and I took six people downstate with me, their luggage crammed in helter-skelter. It wasn't a pleasant ride. For all any of us knew, Springheel Jack might have been in the car with us.

That night the thermometer dropped fifteen degrees, and the whole northern New England area was belted by a shrieking norther that began in sleet and ended in a foot of snow. The usual number of old duffers had heart attacks shovelling it away - and then, like magic, it was April. Clean showers and starry nights.

They called it strawberry spring, God knows why, and it's an evil, lying time that only comes once every eight or ten years. Springheel Jack left with the fog, and by early June, campus conversation had turned to a series of draft protests and a sit-in at the building where a well-known napalm manufacturer was holding job interviews. By June, the subject of Springheel Jack was almost unanimously avoided - at least aloud. I suspect there were many who turned it over and over privately, looking for the one crack in the seemless egg of madness that would make sense of it all.

That was the year I graduated, and the next year was the year I married. A good job in a local publishing house. In 1971 we had a child, and now he's almost school age. A fine and questing boy with my eyes and her mouth.

Then, today's paper.

Of course I knew it was here. I knew it yesterday morning when I got up and heard the mysterious sound of snowmelt running down the gutters, and smelled the salt tang of the ocean from our front porch, nine miles from the nearest beach. I knew strawberry spring had come again when I started home from work last night and had to turn on my headlights against the mist that was already beginning to creep out of the fields and hollows, blurring the lines of the buildings and putting fairy haloes around the street lamps.

This morning's paper says a girl was killed on the New Sharon campus near the Civil War cannons. She was killed last night and found in a melting snowbank. She was not she was not all there.

My wife is upset. She wants to know where I was last night. I can't tell her because I don't remember. I remember starting home from work, and I remember putting my headlights on to search my way through the lovely creeping fog, but that's all I remember.

I've been thinking about that foggy night when I had a headache and walked for air and passed all the lovely shadows without shape or substance. And I've been thinking about the trunk of my car - such an ugly word, trunk -and wondering why in the world I should be afraid to open it.

I can hear my wife as I write this, in the next room, crying. She thinks I was with another woman last night.

And oh dear God, I think so too.

STRAWBERRY SPRING

An enterprising New Hampshire newsman with a passion for the arcane christened the killer Springheel Jack, after the infamous Dr John Hawkins of Bristol, who did five of his wives to death with odd pharmaceutical knick-knacks. And the name, probably because of that soggy yet unmarked ground, stuck.

On the twenty-first it rained again, and the mall and quadrangle became quagmires. The police announced that they were salting plainclothes detectives, men and women, about, and took half the police cars off duty.

The campus newspaper published a strongly indignant, if slightly incoherent, editorial protesting this. The upshot of it seemed to be that, with all sorts of cops masquerading as students, it would be impossible to tell a real outside agitator from a false one.

Twilight came and the fog with it, drifting up the tree-lined avenues slowly, almost thoughtfully, blotting out the buildings one by one. It was soft, insubstantial stuff, but somehow implacable and frightening. Springheel Jack was a man, no one seemed to doubt that, but the fog was his accomplice and it was female. . . or so it seemed to me. If was as if our little school was caught between them, squeezed in some crazy lover's embrace, part of a marriage that had been consummated in blood. I sat and smoked and watched the lights come on in the growing darkness and wondered if it was all over. My room-mate came in and shut the door quietly behind him.

'It's going to snow soon,' he said.

I turned around and looked at him. 'Does the radio say that?'

'No,' he said. 'Who needs a weatherman? Have you ever heard of strawberry spring?'

'Maybe,' I said. 'A long time ago. Something grandmothers talk about, isn't it?'

He stood beside me, looking out at the creeping dark.

'Strawberry spring is like Indian summer,' he said, 'only much more rare. You get a good Indian summer in this part of the country once every two or three years. A spell of weather like we've been having is supposed to come only every eight or ten. It's a false spring, a lying spring, like Indian summer is a false summer. My own grandmother used to say strawberry spring means the worst norther of the winter is still on the way - and the longer this lasts, the harder the storm.

'Folk tales,' I said. 'Never believe a word.' I looked at him. But I'm nervous. Are you?'

He smiled benevolently and stole one of my cigarettes from the open pack on the window ledge. 'I suspect everyone but me. and thee,' he said, and then the smile faded a little. 'And sometimes I wonder about thee. Want to go over to the Union and shoot some eight-ball? I'll spot you ten.'

'Trig prelim next week. I'm going to settle down with a magic marker and a hot pile of notes.'

For a long time after he was gone, I could only look out the window. And even after I had opened my book and started in, part of me was still out there, walking in the shadows where something dark was now in charge.

That night Adelle Parkins was killed. Six police cars and seventeen collegiate-looking plain clothes men (eight of them were women imported all the way from Boston) patrolled the campus. But Springheel Jack killed her just the same, going unerringly for one of our own. The false spring, the lying spring, aided and abetted him - he killed her and left her propped behind the wheel of her 1964 Dodge to be found the next morning and they found part of her in the back seat and part of her in the trunk. And written in blood on the windshield - this time fact instead of rumour - were two words: HA! HA!

The campus went slightly mad after that; all of us and none of us had known Adelle Parkins. She was one of those nameless, harried women who worked the break-back shift in the Grinder from six to eleven at night, facing hordes of hamburger-happy students on study break from the library across the way. She must have had it relatively easy those last three foggy nights of her life; the curfew was 'being rigidly observed, and after nine the Grinder's only patrons were hungry cops and happy janitors - the empty buildings had improved their habitual bad temper considerably.

There is little left to tell. The police, as prone to hysteria as any of us and driven against the wall, arrested an innocuous homosexual sociology graduate student named Hanson Gray, who claimed he 'could not remember' where he had spent several of the lethal evenings. They charged him, arraigned him, and let him go to scamper hurriedly back to his native New Hampshire town after the last unspeakable night of strawberry spring when Marsha Curran was slaughtered on the mall.

Why she had been out and alone is forever beyond knowing - she was a fat, sadly pretty thing who lived in an apartment in town with three other girls. She had slipped on campus as silently and as easily as Springheel Jack himself. What brought her? Perhaps her need was as deep and as ungovernable as her killer's, and just as far beyond understanding. Maybe a need for one desperate and passionate romance with the warm night, the warm fog, the smell of the sea, and the cold knife.

That was on the twenty-third. On the twenty-fourth the president of the college announced that spring break would be moved up a week, and we scattered, not joyfully but like frightened sheep before a storm, leaving the campus empty and haunted by the police and one dark spectre.

I had my own car on campus, and I took six people downstate with me, their luggage crammed in helter-skelter. It wasn't a pleasant ride. For all any of us knew, Springheel Jack might have been in the car with us.

That night the thermometer dropped fifteen degrees, and the whole northern New England area was belted by a shrieking norther that began in sleet and ended in a foot of snow. The usual number of old duffers had heart attacks shovelling it away - and then, like magic, it was April. Clean showers and starry nights.

They called it strawberry spring, God knows why, and it's an evil, lying time that only comes once every eight or ten years. Springheel Jack left with the fog, and by early June, campus conversation had turned to a series of draft protests and a sit-in at the building where a well-known napalm manufacturer was holding job interviews. By June, the subject of Springheel Jack was almost unanimously avoided - at least aloud. I suspect there were many who turned it over and over privately, looking for the one crack in the seemless egg of madness that would make sense of it all.

That was the year I graduated, and the next year was the year I married. A good job in a local publishing house. In 1971 we had a child, and now he's almost school age. A fine and questing boy with my eyes and her mouth.

Then, today's paper.

Of course I knew it was here. I knew it yesterday morning when I got up and heard the mysterious sound of snowmelt running down the gutters, and smelled the salt tang of the ocean from our front porch, nine miles from the nearest beach. I knew strawberry spring had come again when I started home from work last night and had to turn on my headlights against the mist that was already beginning to creep out of the fields and hollows, blurring the lines of the buildings and putting fairy haloes around the street lamps.

This morning's paper says a girl was killed on the New Sharon campus near the Civil War cannons. She was killed last night and found in a melting snowbank. She was not she was not all there.

My wife is upset. She wants to know where I was last night. I can't tell her because I don't remember. I remember starting home from work, and I remember putting my headlights on to search my way through the lovely creeping fog, but that's all I remember.

I've been thinking about that foggy night when I had a headache and walked for air and passed all the lovely shadows without shape or substance. And I've been thinking about the trunk of my car - such an ugly word, trunk -and wondering why in the world I should be afraid to open it.

I can hear my wife as I write this, in the next room, crying. She thinks I was with another woman last night.

And oh dear God, I think so too.

GRAVEYARD SHIFT
Two A.M., Friday.
Hall was sitting on the bench by the elevator, the only place on the third floor where a working joe
could catch a smoke, when Warwick came up. He wasn't happy to see Warwick. The foreman wasn't
supposed to show up on three during the graveyard shift; he was supposed to stay down in his office in
the basement drinking coffee from the urn that stood on the corner of his desk. Besides, it was hot.
It was the hottest June on record in Gates Falls, and the Orange Crush thermometer which was also by
the elevator had once rested at 94 degrees at three in the morning. God only knew what kind of hellhole
the mill was on the three-to-eleven shift.
Hall worked the picker machine, a balky gadget manufactured by a defunct Cleveland firm in 1934. He
had only been working in the mill since April, which meant he was still making minimum $1.78 an
hour, which was still all right. No wife, no steady girl, no alimony. He was a drifter, and during the last
three years he had moved on his thumb from Berkeley (college student) to Lake Tahoe (busboy) to
Galveston (stevedore) to Miami (short-order cook) to Wheeling (taxi driver and dishwasher) to Gates
Falls, Maine (picker-machine operator). He didn't figure on moving again until the snow fell. He was a
solitary person and he liked the hours from eleven to seven when the blood flow of the big mill was at
its coolest, not to mention the temperature.
The only thing he did not like was the rats.
The third floor was long and deserted, lit only by the sputtering glow of the fluorescents. Unlike the
other levels of the mill, it was relatively silent and unoccupied - at least by the humans. The rats were
another matter. The only machine on three was the picker; the rest of the floor was storage for the
ninety-pound bags of fibre which had yet to be sorted by Hall's long gear-toothed machine. They were
stacked like link sausages in long rows, some of them (especially the discontinued meltons and
irregular slipes for which there were no orders) years old and dirty grey with industrial wastes. They
made fine nesting places for the rats, huge, fat-bellied creatures with rabid eyes and bodies that jumped
with lice and vermin.
Hall had developed a habit of collecting a small arsenal of soft-drink cans from the trash barrel during
his break. He pegged them at the rats during times when work was slow, retrieving them later at his
leisure. Only this time Mr Foreman had caught him, coming up the stairs instead of using the elevator
like the sneaky sonofabitch everyone said he was.
'What are you up to, Hall?'
'The rats,' Hall said, realizing how lame that must sound now that all the rats had snuggled safely back
into their houses. 'I peg cans at 'em when I see 'em.'
Warwick nodded once, briefly. He was a big beefy man with a crew cut. His shirtsleeves were rolled up
and his tie was pulled down. He looked at Hall closely. 'We don't pay you to chuck cans at rats, mister.
Not even if you pick them up again.'
'Harry hasn't sent down an order for twenty minutes,' Hall answered, thinking: Why couldn't you stay
the hell put and drink your coffee? 'I can't run it through the picker if I don't have it.'
Warwick nodded as if the topic no longer interested him.
'Maybe I'll take a walk up and see Wisconsky,' he said.
'Five to one he's reading a magazine while the crap piles up in his bins.'
Hall didn't say anything. 
Warwick suddenly pointed. 'There's one! Get the bastard!'
Hall fired the Nehi can he had been holding with one whistling, overhand motion. The rat, which had
been watching him from atop one of the fabric bags with its bright buckshot eyes, fled with one faint
squeak. Warwick threw back his head and laughed as Hall went after the can.
'I came to see you about something else,' Warwick said.
'Is that so?'
'Next week's Fourth of July week.' Hall nodded. The mill would be shut down Monday to Saturday -
vacation week for men with at least one year's tenure. Layoff week for men with less than a year. 'You
want to work?'
Hall shrugged. 'Doing what?'
'We're going to clean the whole basement level. Nobody's touched it for twelve years. Helluva mess.
We're going to use hoses.'
'The town zoning committee getting on the board of directors?'
Warwick looked steadily at Hall. 'You want it or not? Two an hour, double time on the fourth. We're
working the graveyard shift because it'll be cooler.'
Hall calculated. He could clear maybe seventy-five bucks after taxes. Better than the goose egg he had
been looking forward to.
'All right.'
'Report down by the dye house next Monday.'
Hall watched him as he started back to the stairs. Warwick paused halfway there and turned back to
look at Hall. 'You used to be a college boy, didn't you?'
Hall nodded.
'Okay, college boy, I'm keeping it in mind.'
He left. Hall sat down and lit another smoke, holding a soda can in one hand and watching for the rats.
He could just imagine how it would be in the basement - the subbasement, actually, a level below the
dye house. Damp, dark, full of spiders and rotten cloth and ooze from the river
- and rats. Maybe even bats, the aviators of the rodent family. Gah.
Hall threw the can hard, then smiled thinly to himself as the faint sound of Warwick's voice came down
through the overhead ducts, reading Harry Wisconsky the riot act.
Okay, college boy, I'm keeping it in mind.
He stopped smiling abruptly and butted his smoke. A few moments later Wisconsky started to send
rough nylon down through the blowers, and Hall went to work. And after a while the rats came out and
sat atop the bags at the back of the long room watching him with their unblinking black eyes. They
looked like a jury.
Eleven P.M., Monday. 
There were about thirty-six men sitting around when Warwick came in wearing a pair of old jeans
tucked into high rubber boots. Hall had been listening to Harry Wisconsky, who was enormously fat,
enormously lazy, and enormously gloomy.
'It's gonna be a mess,' Wisconsky was saying when Mr Foreman came in. 'You wait and see, we're all
gonna go home blacker'n midnight in Persia.'
'Okay!' Warwick said. 'We strung sixty lightbulbs down there, so it should be bright enough for you to
see what you're doing. You guys -' he pointed to a bunch of men that had been leaning against the
drying spools - 'I want you to hook up the hoses over there to the main water conduit by the stairwell.
You can unroll them down the stairs. We got about eighty yards for each man, and that should be
plenty. Don't get cute and spray one of your buddies or you'll send him to the hospital. They pack
wallop.'
'Somebody'll get hurt,' Wisconsky prophesied sourly. 'Wait and see.'
'You other guys,' Warwick said pointing to the group that Hall and Wisconsky were a part of. 'You're
the crap crew tonight. You go in pairs with an electric wagon for each team. There's old office furniture,
bags of cloth, hunks of busted machinery, you name it. We're gonna pile it by the airshaft at the west
end. Anyone who doesn't know how to run a wagon?'
No one raised a hand. The electric wagons were battery-driven contraptions like miniature dump trucks.
They developed a nauseating stink after continual use that reminded Hall of burning power lines.
'Okay,' Warwick said. 'We got the basement divided up into sections, and we'll be done by Thursday.
Friday we'll chain-hoist the crap out. Questions?'
There were none. Hall studied the foreman's face closely, and he had a sudden premonition of a strange
thing coming. The idea pleased him. He did not like Warwick very much.
'Fine,' Warwick said. 'Let's get at it.'
Two A.M., Tuesday.
Hall was bushed and very tired of listening to Wisconsky's steady patter of profane complaints. He
wondered if it would do any good to belt Wisconsky. He doubted it. It would just give Wisconsky
something else to bitch about.
Hall had known it would be bad, but this was murder. For one thing, he hadn't anticipated the smell.
The polluted stink of the river, mixed with the odour of decaying fabric, rotting masonry, vegetable
matter. In the far corner, where they had begun, Hall discovered a colony of huge white toadstools
poking their way up through the shattered cement. His hands had come in contact with them as he
pulled and yanked at a rusty gear-toothed wheel, and they felt curiously warm and bloated, like the
flesh of a man afflicted with dropsy.
The bulbs couldn't banish the twelve-year darkness; it could only push it back a little and cast a sickly
yellow glow over the whole mess. The place looked like the shattered nave of a desecrated church, with
its high ceiling and mammoth discarded machinery that they would never be able to move, its wet
walls overgrown with patches of yellow moss, and the atonal choir that was the water from the hoses,
running in the half-clogged sewer network that eventually emptied into the river below the falls.
And the rats - huge ones that made those on third look like dwarfs. God knew what they were eating
down here. They were continually overturning boards and bags to reveal huge nests of shredded
newspaper, watching with atavistic loathing as the pups fled into the cracks and crannies, their eyes
huge and blind with the continuous darkness. 
'Let's stop for a smoke,' Wisconsky said. He sounded out of breath, but Hall had no idea why; he had
been goldbrickmg all night. Still, it was about that time, and they were currently out of sight of
everyone else.
'All right.' He leaned against the edge of the electric wagon and lit up.
'I never should've let Warwick talk me into this,' Wisconsky said dolefully. 'This ain't work for a man.
But he was mad the other night when he caught me in the crapper up on four with my pants up. Christ,
was he mad.'
Hall said nothing. He was thinking about Warwick, and about the rats. Strange, how the two things
seemed tied together. The rats seemed to have forgotten all about men in their long stay under the mill;
they were impudent and hardly afraid at all. One of them had sat up on its hind legs like a squirrel until
Hall had got in kicking distance, and then it had launched itself at his boot, biting at the leather.
Hundreds, maybe thousands. He wondered how many varieties of disease they were carrying around in
this black sumphole. And Warwick. Something about him -
'I need the money,' Wisconsky said. 'But Christ Jesus, buddy, this ain't no work for a man. Those rats.'
He looked around fearfully. 'It almost seems like they think. You ever wonder how it'd be, if we was
little and they were big -' 'Oh, shut up,' Hall said.
Wisconsky looked at him, wounded. 'Say, I'm sorry, buddy. It's just that . . .' He trailed off. 'Jesus, this
place stinks!' he cried. 'This ain't no kind of work for a man!' A spider crawled off the edge of the
wagon and scrambled up his arm. He brushed it off with a choked sound of disgust.
'Come on,' Hall said, snuffing his cigarette. 'The faster, the quicker.'
'I suppose,' Wisconsky said miserably. 'I suppose.'
Four A.M., Tuesday. Lunchtime.
Hall and Wisconsky sat with three or four other men, eating their sandwiches with black hands that not
even the industrial detergent could clean. Hall ate looking into the foreman's little glass office.
Warwick was drinking coffee and eating cold hamburgers with great relish.
'Ray Upson had to go home,' Charlie Brochu said.
'He puke?' someone asked. 'I almost did.'
'Nuh. Ray'd eat cowflop before he'd puke. Rat bit him.' Hall looked up thoughtfully from his
examination of Warwick. 'Is that so?' he asked.
'Yeah.' Brochu shook his head. 'I was teaming with him. Goddamndest thing I ever saw. Jumped out of
a hole in one of those old cloth bags. Must have been big as a cat. Grabbed on to his hand and started
chewing.'
'Jee-sus,' one of the men said, looking green.
'Yeah,' Brochu said. 'Ray screamed just like a woman, and I ain't blamin' him. He bled like a pig.
Would that thing let go? No sir. I had to belt it three or four times with a board before it would. Ray
was just about crazy. He stomped it until it wasn't nothing but a mess of fur. Damndest thing I ever saw.
Warwick put a bandage on him and sent him home. Told him to go to the doctor tomorrow.'
'That was big of the bastard,' somebody said. 
As if he had heard, Warwick got to his feet in his office, stretched, and then came to the door. 'Time we
got back with it.'
The men got to their feet slowly, eating up all the time they possibly could stowing their dinner jackets,
getting cold drinks, buying candy bars. Then they started down, heels clanking dispiritedly on the steel
grillework of the stair risers.
Warwick passed Hall, clapping him on the shoulder. 'How's it going, college boy?' He didn't wait for an
answer.
'Come on,' Hall said patiently to Wisconsky, who was tying his shoelace. They went downstairs.
Seven A.M., Tuesday.
Hall and Wisconsky walked out together; it seemed to Hall that he had somehow inherited the fat Pole.
Wisconsky was almost comically dirty, his fat moon face smeared like that of a small boy who has just
been thrashed by the town bully.
There was none of the usual rough banter from the other men, the pulling of shirt-tails, the cracks about
who was keeping Tony's wife warm between the hours of one and four. Nothing but silence and an
occasional hawking sound as someone spat on the dirty floor.
'You want a lift?' Wisconsky asked him hesitantly.
'Thanks.'
They didn't talk as they rode up Mill Street and crossed the bridge. They exchanged only a brief word
when Wisconsky dropped him off in front of his apartment.
Hall went directly to the shower, still thinking about Warwick, trying to place whatever it was about
Mr Foreman that drew him, made him feel that somehow they had become tied together.
He slept as soon as his head hit the pillow, but his sleep was broken and restless: he dreamed of rats.
One A.M., Wednesday.
It was better running the horses.
They couldn't go in until the crap crews had finished a section, and quite often they were done hosing
before the next section was clear - which meant time for a cigarette. Hall worked the nozzle of one of
the long hoses and Wisconsky pattered back and forth, unsnagging lengths of the hose, turning the
water on and off, moving obstructions.
Warwick was short-tempered because the work was proceeding slowly. They would never be done by
Thursday, the way things were going.
Now they were working on a helter-skelter jumble of nineteenth-century office equipment that had
been piled in one corner - smashed rolltop desks, mouldy ledgers, reams of invoices, chairs with broken
seats-and it was rat heaven. Scores of them squeaked and ran through the dark and crazy passages that
honeycombed the heap, and after two men were bitten' the others refused to work until Warwick sent
someone upstairs to get heavy rubberized gloves, the kind usually reserved for the dye-house crew,
which had to work with acids.
Hall and Wisconsky were waiting to go in with their hoses when a sandy-haired bullneck named
Carmichael began howling curses and backing away, slapping at his chest with his gloved hands. 
A huge rat with grey-streaked fur and ugly, glaring eyes had bitten into his shirt and hung there,
squeaking and kicking at Carmichael's belly with its back paws. Carmichael finally knocked it away
with his fist, but there was a huge hole in his shirt, and a thin line of blood trickled from above one
nipple. The anger faded from his face. He turned away and retched.
Hall turned the hose on the rat, which was old and moving slowly, a snatch of Carmichael's shirt still
caught in its jaws. The roaring pressure drove it backward against the wall, where it smashed limply.
Warwick came over, an odd, strained smile on his lips. He clapped Hall on the shoulder. 'Damn sight
better than throwing cans at the little bastards, huh, college boy?'
'Some little bastard,' Wisconsky said. 'It's a foot long.'
'Turn that hose over there.' Warwick pointed at the jumble of furniture. 'You guys, get out of the way!'
'With pleasure,' someone muttered.
Carmichael charged up to Warwick, his face sick and twisted. 'I'm gonna have compensation for this!
I'm gonna -,
'Sure,' Warwick said, smiling. 'You got bit on the titty. Get out of the way before you get pasted down
by this water.'
Hall pointed the nozzle and let it go It hit with a white explosion of spray, knocking over a desk and
smashing two chairs to splinters. Rats ran everywhere, bigger than any Hall had ever seen. He could
hear men crying out in disgust and horror as they fled, things with huge eyes and sleek, plump bodies.
He caught a glimpse of one that looked as big as a healthy six-week puppy. He kept on until he could
see no more, then shut the nozzle down.
'Okay!' Warwick called. 'Let's pick it up!'
'I didn't hire out as no exterminator!' Cy Ippeston called mutinously. Hall had tipped a few with him the
week before. He was a young guy, wearing a smut-stained baseball cap and a T-shirt.
'That you, Ippeston?' Warwick asked genially.
Ippeston looked uncertain, but stepped forward. 'Yeah. I don't want no more of these rats. I hired to
clean up, not to maybe get rabies or typhoid or somethin'. Maybe you best count me out.'
There was a murmur of agreement from the others. Wisconsky stole a look at Hall, but Hall was
examining the nozzle of the hose he was holding. It had a bore like a .45 and could probably knock a
man twenty feet.
'You saying you want to punch your clock, Cy?'
'Thinkin' about it,' Ippeston said.
Warwick nodded. 'Okay. You and anybody else that wants. But this ain't no unionized shop, and never
has been. Punch out now and you'll never punch back in. I'll see to it.'
'Aren't you some hot ticket,' Hall muttered.
Warwick swung around. 'Did you say something, college boy?'
Hall regarded him blandly. 'Just clearing my throat, Mr Foreman.' 
Warwick smiled. 'Something taste bad to you?'
Hall said nothing.
'All right, let's pick it up!' Warwick bawled.
They went back to work.
Two A.M., Thursday.
Hall and Wisconsky were working with the trucks again, picking up junk. The pile by the west airshaft
had grown to amazing proportions, but they were still not half done.
'Happy Fourth,' Wisconsky said when they stopped for a smoke. They were working near the north
wall, far from the stairs. The light was extremely dim, and some trick of acoustics made the other men
seem miles away.
'Thanks.' Hall dragged on his smoke. 'Haven't seen many rats tonight.'
'Nobody has,' Wisconsky said. 'Maybe they got wise.'
They were standing at the end of a crazy, zigzagging alley formed by piles of old ledgers and invoices,
mouldy bags of cloth, and two huge flat looms of ancient vintage. 'Gah,' Wisconsky said, spitting. 'That
Warwick -'
'Where do you suppose all the rats got to?' Hall asked, almost to himself. 'Not into the walls -' He
looked at the wet and crumbling masonry that surrounded the huge foundation stones. 'They'd drown.
The river's saturated everything.'
Something black and flapping suddenly dive-bombed them. Wisconsky screamed and put his hands
over his head.
'A bat,' Hall said, watching after it as Wisconsky straightened up.
'A bat! A bat!' Wisconsky raved. 'What's a bat doing in the cellar? They're supposed to be in trees and
under eaves and -'
'It was a big one,' Hall said softly. 'And what's a bat but a rat with wings?'
'Jesus,' Wisconsky moaned. 'How did it -'
'Get in? Maybe the same way the rats got out.'
'What's going on back there?' Warwick shouted from somewhere behind them. 'Where are you?'
'Don't sweat it,' Hall said softly. His eyes gleamed in the dark.
'Was that you, college boy?' Warwick called. He sounded closer.
'It's okay!' Hall yelled. 'I barked my shin!' Warwick's short, barking laugh. 'You want a Purple Heart?'
Wisconsky looked at Hall. 'Why'd you say that?'
'Look.' Hall knelt and lit a match. There was a square in the middle of the wet and crumbling cement.
'Tap it.' 
Wisconsky did. 'It's wood.'
Hall nodded. 'It's the top of a support. I've seen some other ones around here. There's another level
under this part of the basement.'
'God,' Wisconsky said with utter revulsion.
Three-thirty A.M., Thursday.
They were in the north-east corner, Ippeston and Brochu behind them with one of the high-pressure
hoses, when Hall stopped and pointed at the floor. 'There I thought we'd come across it.'
There was a wooden trapdoor with a crusted iron ring-bolt set near the centre.
He walked back to Ippeston and said, 'Shut it off for a minute.' When the hose was choked to a trickle,
he raised his voice to a shout. 'Hey! Hey, Warwick! Better come here a minute!'
Warwick came splashing over, looking at Hall with that same hard smile in his eyes. 'Your shoelace
come untied, college boy?'
'Look,' Hall said. He kicked the trapdoor with his foot. 'Sub-cellar.'
'So what?' Warwick asked. 'This isn't break time, col-'
'That's where your rats are,' Hall said. 'They're breeding down there. Wisconsky and I even saw a bat
earlier.'
Some of the other men had gathered around and were looking at the trapdoor.
'I don't care,' Warwick said. 'The job was the basement, not -'
'You'll need about twenty exterminators, trained ones,' Hall was saying. 'Going to cost the management
a pretty penny. Too bad.'
Someone laughed. 'Fat chance.'
Warwick looked at Hall as if he were a bug under glass. 'You're really a case, you are,' he said,
sounding fascinated. 'Do you think I give a good goddamn how many rats there are under there?'
'I was at the library this afternoon and yesterday,' Hall said. 'Good thing you kept reminding me I was a
college boy. I read the town zoning ordinances, Warwick they were set up in 1911, before this mill got
big enough to co-opt the zoning board. Know what I found?'
Warwick's eyes were cold. 'Take a walk, college boy. You're fired.'
'I found out,' Hall ploughed on as if he hadn't heard, 'I found out that there is a zoning law in Gates
Falls about vermin. You spell that v-e-r-m-i-n, in case you wondered. It means disease-carrying
animals such as bats, skunks, - unlicensed dogs - and rats. Especially rats. Rats are mentioned fourteen
times in two paragraphs, Mr Foreman. So you just keep in mind that the minute I punch out I'm going
straight to the town commissioner and tell him what the situation down here is.'
He paused, relishing Warwick's hate-congested face. 'I think that between me, him, and the town
committee, we can get an injunction slapped on this place. You're going to be shut down a lot longer
than just Saturday, Mr Foreman. And I got a good idea what your boss is going to say when he turns up.
Hope your unemployment insurance is paid up, Warwick.' 
Warwick's hands formed into claws. 'You damned snot-nose, I ought to -' He looked down at the
trapdoor, and suddenly his smile reappeared. 'Consider yourself rehired, college boy.'
'I thought you might see the light.'
Warwick nodded, the same strange grin on his face.
You're just so smart. I think maybe you ought to go down 'There, Hall, so we got somebody with a
college education to give us an informed opinion. You and Wisconsky.'
'Not me!' Wisconsky exclaimed. 'Not me, I-'
Warwick looked at him. 'You what?'
Wisconsky shut up.
'Good,' Hall said cheerfully. 'We'll need three flashlights. I think I saw a whole rack of those six-battery
jobs in the main office, didn't I?'
'You want to take somebody else?' Warwick asked expansively. 'Sure, pick your man.'
'You,' Hall said gently. The strange expression had come into his face again. 'After all, the management
should be represented, don't you think? Just so Wisconsky and I don't see too many rats down there?'
Someone (it sounded like Ippeston) laughed loudly.
Warwick looked at the men carefully. They studied the tips of their shoes. Finally he pointed at Brochu.
'Brochu, go up to the office and get three flashlights. Tell the watchman I said to let you in.'
'Why'd you get me into this?' Wisconsky moaned to Hall. 'You know I hate those -'
'It wasn't me,' Hall said, and looked at Warwick.
Warwick looked back at him, and neither would drop his eyes.
Four A.M., Thursday.
Brochu returned with the flashlights. He gave one to Hall, one to Wisconsky, one to Warwick.
'Ippeston! Give the hose to Wisconsky.' Ippeston did so. The nozzle trembled delicately between the
Pole's hands.
'All right,' Warwick said to Wisconsky. 'You're in the middle. If there are rats, you let them have it.'
Sure, Hall thought. And if there are rats, Warwick won't see them. And neither will Wisconsky, after he
finds an extra ten in his pay envelope.
Warwick pointed at two of the men. 'Lift it.'
One of them bent over the ringbolt and pulled. For a moment Hall didn't think it was going to give, and
then it yanked free with an odd, crunching snap. The other man put his fingers on the underside to help
pull, then withdrew with a cry. His hands were crawling with huge and sightless beetles. 
With a convulsive grunt the man on the ringbolt pulled the trap back and let it drop. The underside was
black with an odd fungus that Hall had never seen before. The beetles dropped off into the darkness
below or ran across the floor to be crushed.
'Look,' Hall said.
There was a rusty lock bolted on the underside, now broken. 'But it shouldn't be underneath,' Warwick
said. 'It should be on top. Why -'
'Lots of reasons,' Hall said. 'Maybe so nothing on this side could open it - at least when the lock was
new. Maybe so nothing on that side could get up.'
'But who locked it?' Wisconsky asked.
'Ah,' Hall said mockingly, looking at Warwick. 'A mystery.'
'Listen,' Brochu whispered.
'Oh, God,' Wisconsky sobbed. 'I ain't going down there!'
It was a soft sound, almost expectant; the whisk and patter of thousands of paws, the squeaking of rats.
'Could be frogs,' Warwick said.
Hall laughed aloud.
Warwick shone his light down. A sagging flight of wooden stairs led down to the black stones of the
floor beneath. There was not a rat in sight.
'Those stairs won't hold us,' Warwick said with finality.
Brochu took two steps forward and jumped jip and down on the first step. It creaked but showed no
sign of giving way.
'I didn't ask you to do that,' Warwick said.
'You weren't there when that rat bit Ray,' Brochu said softly.
'Let's go,' Hall said.
Warwick took a last sardonic look around at the circle of men, then walked to the edge with Hall.
Wisconsky stepped reluctantly between them. They went down one at a time. Hall, then Wisconsky,
then Warwick. Their flashlight beams played over the floor, which was twisted and heaved into a
hundred crazy hills and valleys. The hose thumped along behind Wisconsky like a clumsy serpent.
When they got to the bottom, Warwick flashed his light around. It picked out a few rotting boxes, some
barrels, little else. The seep from the river stood in puddles that came to ankle depth on their boots.
'I don't hear them any more,' Wisconsky whispered.
They walked slowly away from the trapdoor, their feet shuffling through the slime. Hall paused and
shone his light on a huge wooden box with white letters on it. 'Elias Varney,' he read, '1841. Was the
mill here then?'
'No,' Warwick said. 'It wasn't built until 1897. What difference?' 
Hall didn't answer. They walked forward again. The sub-cellar was longer than it should have been, it
seemed.
The stench was stronger, a smell of decay and rot and things buried. And still the only sound was the
faint, cavelike drip of water.
'What's that?' Hall asked, pointing his beam at a jut of concrete that protruded perhaps two feet into the
cellar. Beyond it, the darkness continued and it seemed to Hall that he could now hear sounds up there,
curiously stealthy.
Warwick peered at it. 'It's. . . no, that can't be right.'
'Outer wall of the mill, isn't it? and up ahead
'I'm going back,' Warwick said, suddenly turning around.
Hall grabbed his neck roughly. 'You're not going anywhere, Mr Foreman.'
Warwick looked up at him, his grin cutting the darkness. 'You're crazy, college boy. Isn't that right?
Crazy as a loon.'
'You shouldn't push people, friend, keep going.'
Wisconsky moaned. 'Hall -'
'Give me that.' Hall grabbed the hose. He let go of Warwick's neck and pointed the hose at his head.
Wisconsky turned abruptly and crashed back towards the trapdoor. Hall did not even turn. 'After you,
Mr Foreman.'
Warwick stepped forward, walking under the place where the mill ended above them. Hall flashed his
light about, and felt a cold satisfaction - premonition fulfilled. The rats had closed in around them,
silent as death. Crowded in, rank on rank. Thousands of eyes looked greedily back at him. In ranks to
the wall, some fully as high as a man's shin.
Warwick saw them a moment later and came to a full stop. 'They're all around us, college boy.' His
voice was still calm, still in control, but it held a jagged edge.
'Yes,' Hall said. 'Keep going.'
They walked forward, the hose dragging behind. Hall looked back once and saw the rats had closed the
aisle behind them and were gnawing at the heavy canvas hosing.
One looked up and almost seemed to grin at him before lowering his head again. He could see the bats
now, too. They were roosting from the rough-hewn overheads, huge, the size of crows or rooks.
'Look,' Warwick said, centring his beam about five feet ahead.
A skull, green with mould, laughed up at them. Further on Hall could see an ulna, one pelvic wing, part
of a ribcage. 'Keep going,' Hall said. He felt something bursting up inside him, something lunatic and
dark with colours. You are going to break before I do, Mr Foreman, so help me God.
They walked past the bones. The rats were not crowding them; their distances appeared constant. Up
ahead Hall saw one cross their path of travel. Shadows hid it, but he caught sight of a pink twitching
tail as thick as a telephone cord. 
Up ahead the flooring rose sharply, then dipped. Hall could hear a stealthy, rustling sound, a bit sound.
Some-thing that perhaps no living man had ever seen. It occurred to Hall that he had perhaps been
looking for something like this through all his days of crazy wandering.
The rats were moving in, creeping on their bellies, forcing them forward. 'Look,' Warwick said coldly.
Hall saw. Something had happened to the rats back here, some hideous mutation that never could have
survived under the eye of the sun; nature would have forbidden it. But down here, nature had taken on
another ghastly face.
The rats were gigantic, some as high as three feet. But their rear legs were gone and they were blind as
moles, like their flying cousins. They dragged themselves forward with hideous eagerness.
Warwick turned and faced Hall, the smile hanging on by brute willpower. Hall really had to admire
him. 'We can't go on, Hall. You must see that.'
'The rats have business with you, I think,' Hall said.
Warwick's control slipped. 'Please,' he said. 'Please.'
Hall smiled. 'Keep going.'
Warwick was looking over his shoulder. 'They're gnawmg into the hose. When they get through it,
we'll never get back.'
'I know. Keep going.'
'You're insane -' A rat ran across Warwick's shoe and he screamed. Hall smiled and gestured with his
light. They were all around, the closest of them less than a foot away now.
Warwick began to walk again. The rats drew back.
They topped the miniature rise and looked down. Warwick reached it first, and Hall saw his face go
white as paper. Spit ran down his chin. 'Oh, my God. Dear Jesus.
And he turned to run.
Hall opened the nozzle of the hose and the high-pressure rush of water struck Warwick squarely on the
chest, knocking him back out of sight. There was a long scream that rose over the sound of the water.
Thrashing sounds.
'Hall" Grunts. A huge, tenebrous squeaking that seemed to fill the earth.
'HALL FOR GOD'S SAKE -'
A sudden wet ripping noise. Another scream, weaker. Something huge shifted and turned. Quite
distinctly Hall heard the wet snap that a fractured bone makes.
A legless rat, guided by some bastard form of sonar, lunged against him, biting. Its body was flabby,
warm. Almost absently Hall turned the hose on it, knocking it away. The hose did not have quite so
much pressure now.
Hall walked to the brow of the wet hill and looked down. The rat filled the whole gully at the far end of
that noxious tomb. It was a huge and pulsating grey, eyeless, totally without legs. When Hall's light
struck it, it made a hideous mewling noise. Their queen, then, the magna mater. A huge and nameless 
thing whose progeny might some day develop wings. It seemed to dwarf what remained of Warwick,
but that was probably just illusion. It was the shock of seeing a rat as big as a Holstein calf.
'Goodbye, Warwick;' Hall said. The rat crouched over Mr Foreman jealously, ripping at one limp arm.
Hall turned away and began to make his way back rapidly, halting the rats with his hose, which was
growing less and less potent. Some of them got through and attacked his legs above the tops of his
boots with biting lunges. One hung stubbornly on at his thigh, ripping at the cloth of his corduroy pants.
Hall made a fist and smashed it aside.
He was nearly three-quarters of the way back when the huge whirring filled the darkness. He looked up
and the gigantic flying form smashed into his face.
The mutated bats had not lost their tails yet. It whipped around Hall's neck in a loathsome coil and
squeezed as the teeth sought the soft spot under his neck. It wriggled and flapped with its membranous
wings, clutching the tatters of his shirt for purchase.
Hall brought the nozzle of the hose up blindly and struck at its yielding body again and again. It fell
away and he trampled it beneath his feet, dimly aware that he was screaming. The rats ran in a flood
over his feet, up his legs.
He broke into a staggering run, shaking some off. The others bit at his belly, his chest. One ran up his
shoulder and pressed its questing muzzle into the cup of his ear.
He ran into the second bat. It roosted on his head for a moment, squealing, and then ripped away a flap
of Hall's scalp.
He felt his body growing numb. His ears filled with the screech and yammer of many rats. He gave one
last heave, stumbled over furry bodies, fell to his knees. He began to laugh, a high, screaming sound.
Five A.M., Thursday.
'Somebody better go down there,' Brochu said tentatively.
'Not me,' Wisconsky whispered. 'Not me.'
'No, not you, jelly belly,' Ippeston said with contempt.
'Well, let's go,' Brogan said, bringing up another hose. 'Me, Ippeston, Dangerfield, Nedeau. Stevenson,
go up to the office and get a few more lights.'
Ippeston looked down into the darkness thoughtfully. 'Maybe they stopped for a smoke,' he said. 'A few
rats, what the hell.'
Stevenson came back with the lights; a few moments later they started down.

 I AM THE DOORWAY

Richard and I sat on my porch, looking out over the dunes to the Gulf. The smoke from his cigar drifted
mellowly in the air, keeping the mosquitoes at a safe distance. The water was a cool aqua, the sky a deeper, truer
blue. It was a pleasant combination.

'You are the doorway,' Richard repeated thoughtfully. 'You are sure you killed the boy - you didn't just dream it?'

'I didn't dream it. And I didn't kill him, either - I told you that. They did. I am the doorway.'

Richard sighed. 'You buried him?'

'Yes.'

'You remember where?'

'Yes.' I reached into my breast pocket and got a cigarette. My hands were awkward with their covering of
bandages. They itched abominably. 'If you want to see it, you'll have to get the dune buggy. You can't roll this -' I
indicated my wheelchair - 'through the sand.' Richard's dune buggy was a 1959 VW with pillow-sized tyres. He
collected driftwood in it. Ever since he retired from the real estate business in Maryland he had been living on
Key Caroline and building driftwood sculptures which he sold to the winter tourists at shameless prices.

He puffed his cigar and looked out at the Gulf. 'Not yet. Will you tell me once more?'

I sighed and tried to light my cigarette. He took the matches away from me and did it himself. I puffed twice,
dragging deep. The itch in my fingers was maddening.

'All right,' I said. 'Last night at seven I was out here, looking at the Gulf and smoking, just like now, and J..’

'Go further back,' he invited.

'Further?'

'Tell me about the flight.'

I shook my head. 'Richard, we've been through it and through it. There's nothing -'

The seamed and fissured face was as enigmatic as one of his own driftwood sculptures. 'You may remember,' he
said. 'Now you may remember.'

'Do you think so?'

'Possibly. And when you're through, we can look for the grave.'

'The grave,' I said. It had a hollow, horrible ring, darker than anything, darker even than all that terrible ocean
Cory and I had sailed through five years ago. Dark, dark, dark.

Beneath the bandages, my new eyes stared blindly into the darkness the bandages forced on them. They itched.

Cory and I were boosted into orbit by the Saturn 16, the one all the commentators called the Empire State
Building booster. It was a big beast, all right. It made the old Saturn 1-B look like a Redstone, and it took off
from a bunker two hundred feet deep - it had to, to keep from taking half of Cape Kennedy with it.

We swung around the earth, verifying all our systems, and then did our inject. Headed out for Venus. We left a
Senate fighting over an appropriations bill for further deep-space exploration, and a bunch of NASA people
praying that we would find something, anything.

'It don't matter what,' Don Lovinger, Project Zeus's private whiz kid, was very fond of saying when he'd had a
few. 'You got all the gadgets, plus five souped-up TV cameras and a nifty little telescope with a zillion lenses and
filters. Find some gold or platinum. Better yet, find some nice, dumb little blue men for us to study and exploit
and feel superior to. Anything. Even the ghost of Howdy Doody would be a start.'

Cory and I were anxious enough to oblige, if we could. Nothing had worked for the deep-space programme.
From Borman, Anders, and Lovell, who orbited the moon in '6~ and found an empty, forbidding world that
looked like dirty beach sand, to Markhan and Jacks, who touched down on Mars eleven years later to find an arid
wasteland of frozen sand and a few struggling lichens, the deep-space programme had been an expensive bust.
And there had been casualties - Pederson and Lederer, eternally circling the sun when all at once nothing worked
on the second-to4ast Apollo flight. John Davis, whose little orbiting observatory was holed by a meteoroid in a
one-in-a-thousand fluke. No, the space programme was hardly swinging along. The way things looked, the Venus
orbit might be our last chance to say we told you so.

It was sixteen days out - we ate a lot of concentrates, played a lot of gin, and swapped a cold back and forth - and
from the tech side it was a milk run. We lost an air-moisture converter on the third day out, went to backup, and
that was all, except for flits and nats, until re-entry. We watched Venus grow from a star to a quarter to a milky
crystal ball, swapped jokes with Huntsville Control, listened to tapes of Wagner and the Beatles, tended to
automated experiments which had to do with everything from measurements of the solar wind to deep-space
navigation. We did two midcourse corrections, both of them infinitesimal, and nine days into the flight Cory went
outside and banged on the retractable DESA until it decided to operate. There was nothing else out of the
ordinary until.

'DESA,' Richard said. 'What's that?'

'An experiment that didn't pan out. NASA-ese for Deep Space Antenna - we were broadcasting pi in high-
frequency pulses for anyone who cared to listen.' I rubbed my fingers against my pants, but it was no good; if
anything, it made it worse. 'Same idea as that radio telescope in West Virginia - you know, the one that listens to
the stars. Only instead of listening, we were transmitting, primarily to the deeper space planets - Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus. If there's any intelligent life out there, it was taking a nap.'

'Only Cory went out?'

'Yes. And if he brought in any interstellar plague, the telemetry didn't show it.'

'Still -'

'It doesn't matter,' I said crossly. 'Only the here and now matters. They killed the boy last night, Richard. It wasn't
a nice thing to watch - or feel. His head. . . it exploded. As if someone had scooped out his brains and put a hand
grenade in his skull.'

'Finish the story,' he said.

I laughed hollowly. 'What's to tell?'

We went into an eccentric orbit around the planet. It was radical and deteriorating, three twenty by seventy-six
miles. That was on the first swing. The second swing our apogee was even higher, the perigree lower. We had a
max of four orbits. We made all four. We got a good look at the planet. Also over six hundred stills and God
knows how many feet of film.

The cloud cover is equal parts methane, ammonia, dust, and flying shit. The whole planet looks like the Grand
Canyon in a wind tunnel. Cory estimated windspeed at about 600mph near the surface. Our probe beeped all the
way down and then went out with a squawk. We saw no vegetation and no sign of life. Spectroscope indicated
only traces of the valuable minerals. And that was Venus. Nothing but nothing - except it scared me. It was like
circling a haunted house in the middle of deep space. I know how unscientific that sounds, but I was scared
gutless until we got out of there. I think if our rockets hadn't gone off, I would have cut my throat on the way
down. It's not like the moon. The moon is desolate but somehow antiseptic. That world we saw was utterly unlike
anything that anyone has ever seen. Maybe it's a good thing that cloud cover is there. It was like a skull that's
been picked clean -that's the closest I can get.

On the way back we heard the Senate had voted to halve space-exploration funds. Cory said something like
'looks like we're back in the weather-satellite business, Artie.' But I was almost glad. Maybe we don't belong out
there.

Twelve days later Cory was dead and I was crippled for life. We bought all our trouble on the way down. The
chute was fouled. How's that for life's little ironies? We'd been in space for over a month, gone further than any
humans had ever gone, and it all ended the way it did because some guy was in a hurry for his coffee break and
let a few lines get fouled.

We came down hard. A guy that was in one of the copters said it looked like a gigantic baby falling out of the
sky, with the placenta trailing after it. I lost consciousness when we hit.

I came to when they were taking me across the deck of the Portland. They hadn't even had a chance to roll up the
red carpet we were supposed to've walked on. I was bleeding. Bleeding and being hustled up to the infirmary

over a red carpet that didn't look anywhere near as red as I did...

I was in Bethesda for two years. They gave me the Medal of Honor and a lot of money and this wheelchair. I
came down here the next year. I like to watch the rockets take off.'

'I know,' Richard said. He paused. 'Show me your hands.'

'No.' It came out very quickly and sharply. 'I can't let them see. I've told you that.'

'It's been five years,' Richard said. 'Why now, Arthur? Can you tell me that?'

'I don't know. I don't know! Maybe whatever it is has a long gestation period. Or who's to say I even got it out
there? Whatever it was might have entered me in Fort Lauderdale. Or right here on this porch, for all I know.'

Richard sighed and looked out over the water, now reddish with the late-evening sun. 'I'm trying. Arthur, I don't
want to think that you are losing your mind.'

'If I have to, I'll show you my hands,' I said. It cost me an effort to say it. 'But only if I have to.'

Richard stood up and found his cane. He looked old and frail. 'I'll get the dune buggy. We'll look for the boy.'

'Thank you, Richard.'

He walked out towards the rutted dirt track that led to his cabin - I could just see the roof of it over the Big Dune,
the one that runs almost the whole length of Key Caroline. Over the water towards the Cape, the sky had gone an
ugly plum colour, and the sound of thunder came faintly to my ears.

I didn't know the boy's name but I saw him every now and again, walking along the beach at sunset, with his
sieve under his arm. He was tanned almost black by the sun, and all he was ever clad in was a frayed pair of
denim cutoffs. On the far side of Key Caroline there is a public beach, and an enterprising young man can make
perhaps as much as five dollars on a good day, patiently sieving the sand for buried quarters or dimes. Every now
and then I would wave to him and he would wave back, both of us non-commital, strangers yet brothers, year-
round dwellers set against a sea of money spending, Cadillac-driving, loud-mouthed tourists. I imagine he lived
in the small village clustered around the post office about a half mile further down.

When he passed by that evening I had already been on the porch for an hour, immobile, watching. I had taken off
the bandages earlier. The itching had been intolerable, and it was always better when they could look through
their eyes.

It was a feeling like no other in the world - as if I were a portal just slightly ajar through which they were peeking
at a world which they hated and feared. But the worst part was that I could see, too, in a way. Imagine your mind
transported into a body of a housefly, a housefly looking into your own face with a thousand eyes. Then perhaps
you can begin to see why I kept my hands bandaged even when there was no one around to see them.

It began in Miami. I had business there with a man named Cresswell, an investigator from the Navy Department.
He checks up on me once a year - for a while I was as close as anyone ever gets to the classified stuff our space
programme has. I don't know just what it is he looks for; a shifty gleam in the eye, maybe, or maybe a scarlet
letter on my forehead. God knows why. My pension is large enough to be almost embarrassing.

Cresswell and I were sitting on the terrace of his hotel room, sipping drinks and discussing the future of the US
space programme. It was about three-fifteen. My fingers began to itch. It wasn't a bit gradual. It was switched on
like electric current. I mentioned it to Cresswell.

'So you picked up some poison ivy on that scrofulous little island,' he said, grinning.

'The only foliage on Key Caroline is a little palmetto scrub,' I said. 'Maybe it's the seven-year itch.' I looked down
at my hands. Perfectly ordinary hands. But itchy.

Later in the afternoon I signed the same old paper ('I do solemnly swear that I have neither received nor disclosed
and divulged information which would . . .') and drove myself back to the Key. I've got an old Ford, equipped
with hand-operated brake and accelerator. I love it - it makes me feel self-sufficient.

It's a long drive back, down Route 1, and by the time I got off the big road and on to the Key Caroline exit ramp,
I was nearly out of my mind. My hands itched maddeningly. If you have ever suffered through the healing of a
deep cut or a surgical incision, you may have some idea of the kind of itch I mean. Live things seemed to be
crawling and boring in my flesh.

The sun was almost down and I looked at my hands carefully in the glow of the dash lights. The tips of them
were red now, red in tiny, perfect circlets, just above the pad where the fingerprint is, where you get calluses if
you play guitar. There were also red circles of infection on the space between the first and second joint of each
thumb and finger, and on the skin between the second joint and the knuckle. I pressed my right fingers to my lips
and withdrew them quickly, with a sudden loathing. A feeling of dumb horror had risen in my throat, woollen
and choking. The flesh where the red spots had appeared was hot, feverish, and the flesh was soft and gelid, like
the flesh of an apple gone rotten.

I drove the rest of the way trying to persuade myself that I had indeed caught poison ivy somehow. But in the
back of my mind there was another ugly thought. I had an aunt, back in my childhood, who lived the last ten
years of her life closed off from the world in an upstairs room. My mother took her meals up, and her name was a
forbidden topic. I found out later that she had Hansen's disease -leprosy.

When I got home I called Dr Flanders on the mainland. I got his answering service instead. Dr Flanders was on a
fishing cruise, but if it was urgent, Dr Ballanger -'When will Dr Flanders be back?'

'Tomorrow afternoon at the latest. Would that -' 'Sure.'

I hung up slowly, then dialled Richard. I let it ring a dozen times before hanging up. After that I sat indecisive for
a while. The itching had deepened. It seemed to emanate from the flesh itself.

I rolled my wheelchair over to the bookcase and pulled down the battered medical encyclopedia that I'd had for
years. The book was maddeningly vague. It could have been anything, or nothing.

I leaned back and closed my eyes. I could hear the old ship's clock ticking on the shelf across the room. There
was the high, thin drone of a jet on its way to Miami. There was the soft whisper of my own breath.

I was still looking at the book.

The realization crept on me, then sank home with a frightening rush. My eyes were closed, but I was still looking
at the book. What I was seeing was smeary and monstrous, the distorted, fourth-dimensional counterpart of a
book, yet unmistakable for all that.

And I was not the only one watching.

I snapped my eyes open, feeling the constriction of my heart. The sensation subsided a little, but not entirely. I
was looking at the book, seeing the print and diagrams with my own eyes, perfectly normal everyday experience,
and I was also seeing it from a different, lower angle and seeing it with other eyes. Seeing not a book but an alien
thing, something of monstrous shape and ominous intent.

I raised my hands slowly to my face, catching an eerie vision of my living room turned into a horror house.

I screamed.

There were eyes peering up at me through splits in the flesh of my fingers. And even as I watched the flesh was
dilating, retreating, as they pushed their mindless way up to the surface.

But that was not what made me scream. I had looked into my own face and seen a monster.

The dune buggy nosed over the hill and Richard brought it to a halt next to the porch. The motor gunned and
roared choppily. I rolled my wheelchair down the inclined plane to the right of the regular steps and Richard
helped me in.

'All right, Arthur,' he said. 'It's your party. Where to?'

I pointed down towards the water, where the Big Dune family begins to peter out. Richard nodded. The rear
wheels spun sand and we were off. I usually found time to rib Richard about his driving, but I didn't bother
tonight. There was too much else to think about - and to feel: they didn't want the dark, and I could feel them
straining to see through the bandages, willing me to take them off.

The dune buggy bounced and roared through the sand towards the water, seeming almost to take flight from the
tops of the small dunes. To the left the sun was going down in bloody glory. Straight ahead and across the water,
the thunderclouds were beating their way towards us. Lightning forked at the water.

'Off to your right,' I said. 'By that lean-to.'

Richard brought the dune buggy to a sand-spraying halt beside the rotted remains of the lean-to, reached into the
back, and brought out a spade. I winced when I saw it. 'Where?' Richard asked expressionlessly.

'Right there.' I pointed to the place.

He got out and walked slowly through the sand to the spot, hesitated for a second, then plunged the shovel into
the sand. It seemed that he dug for a very long time. The sand he was throwing back over his shoulder looked
damp and moist. The thunderheads were darker, higher, and the water looked angry and implacable under their
shadow and the reflected glow of the sunset.

I knew long before he stopped digging that he was not going to find the boy. They had moved him. I hadn't
bandaged my hands last night, so they could see - and act. If they had been able to use me to kill the boy, they
could use me to move him, even while I slept.

'There's no boy, Arthur.' He threw the dirty shovel into the dune buggy and sat tiredly on the seat. The coming
storm cast marching, crescent-shaped shadows along the sand. The rising breeze rattled sand against the buggy's
rusted body. My fingers itched.

'They used me to move him,' I said dully. 'They're getting the upper hand, Richard. They're forcing their doorway
open, a little at a time. A hundred times a day I find myself standing in front of some perfectly familiar object - a
spatula, a picture, even a can of beans - with no idea how I got there, holding my hands out, showing it to them,
seeing it as they do, as an obscenity, something twisted and grotesque -'Arthur,' he said. 'Arthur, don't. Don't.' In
the failing light his face was wan with compassion. 'Standing in front of something, you said. Moving the boy's
body, you said': But you can't walk, Arthur. You're dead from the waist down.'

I touched the dashboard of the dune buggy. 'This is dead, too. But when you enter it, you can make it go. You
could make it kill. It couldn't stop you even if it wanted to.' I could hear my voice rising hysterically. 'I am the
doorway, can't you understand that? They killed the boy, Richard! They moved the body!'

'I think you'd better see a medical man,' he said quietly. 'Let's go back. Let's -,

'Check! Check on the boy, then! find out -'

'You said you didn't even know his name.'

'He must have been from the village. It's a small village. Ask -'

'I talked to Maud Harrington on the phone when I got the dune buggy. If anyone in the state has a longer nose,
I've not come across her. I asked if she'd heard of anyone's boy not coming home last night. She said she hadn't.'

'But he's a local! He has to be!'

He reached for the ignition switch but I stopped him. He turned to look at me and I began to unwrap my hands.

From the Gulf, thunder muttered and growled.

I didn't go to the doctor and I didn't call Richard back. I spent three weeks with my hands bandaged every time I
went out. Three weeks just blindly hoping it would go away. It wasn't a rational act; I can admit that. If I had
been a whole man who didn't need a wheelchair for legs or who had spent a normal life in a normal occupation, I
might have gone to Doc Flanders or to Richard. I still might have, if it hadn't been for the memory of my aunt,
shunned, virtually a prisoner, being eaten alive by her own ailing flesh. So I kept a desperate silence and prayed
that I would wake up some morning and find it had been an evil dream.

And little by little, I felt them. Them. An anonymous intelligence. I never really wondered what they looked like
or where they had come from. It was moot. I was their doorway, and their window on the world. I got enough
feedback from them to feel their revulsion and horror, to know that our world was very different from theirs.
Enough feedback to feel their blind hate. But still they watched. Their flesh was embedded in my own. I began to
realize that they were using me, actually manipulating me.

When the boy passed, raising one hand in his usual noncommittal salute, I had just about decided to get in touch
with Cresswell at his Navy Department number. Richard had been right about one thing - I was certain that
whatever had got hold of me had done it in deep space or in that weird orbit around Venus. The Navy would
study me, but they would not freakify me. I wouldn't have to wake up any more into the creaking darkness and
stifle a scream as I felt them watching, watching, watching.

My hands went out towards the boy and I realized that I had not bandaged them. I could see the eyes in the dying
light, watching silently. They were large, dilated, goldenirised. I had poked one of them against the tip of a pencil
once, and had felt excruciating agony slam up my arm. The eye seemed to glare at me with a chained hatred that
was worse than physical pain. I did not poke again.

And now they were watching the boy. I felt my mind sideslip. A moment later my control was gone. The door
was open. I lurched across the sand towards him, legs scissoring nervelessly, so much driven deadwood. My own
eyes seemed to close and I saw only with those alien eyes -saw a monstrous alabaster seascape overtopped with a
sky like a great purple way, saw a leaning, eroded shack that might have been the carcas of some unknown,
fleshdevouring creature, saw an abominated creature that moved and respired and carried a device of wood and
wire under its arm, a device constructed of geometrically impossible right angles.

I wonder what he thought, that wretched, unnamed boy with his sieve under his arm and his pockets bulging with
an odd conglomerate of sandy tourist coins, what he thought when he saw me lurching at him like a blind
conductor stretching out his hands over a lunatic orchestra, what he thought as the last of the light fell across my
hands, red and split and shining with their burden of eyes, what he thought when the hands made that sudden,
flailing gesture in the air, just before his head burst.

I know what I thought.

I thought I had peeked over the rim of the universe and into the fires of hell itself.

The wind pulled at the bandages and made them into tiny, whipping streamers as I unwrapped them. The clouds
had blottered the red remnants of the sunset, and the dunes were dark and shadow-cast. The clouds raced and
boiled above us.

'You must promise me one thing, Richard,' I said over the rising wind. 'You must run if it seems I might try. . . to
hurt you. Do you understand that?'

'Yes.' He open-throated shirt whipped and rippled with the wind. His face was set, his own eyes little more than
sockets in early dark.

The last of the bandages fell away.

I looked at Richard and they looked at Richard. I saw a face I had known for five years and come to love. They
saw a distorted, living monolith.

'You see them,' I said. hoarsely. 'Now you see them.'

He took an involuntary step backwards. His face became stained with a sudden unbelieving terror. Lightning
slashed out of the sky. Thunder walked in the clouds and the water had gone black as the river Styx.

'Arthur -'

How hideous he was! How could I have lived near him, spoken with him? He was not a creature, but mute
pestilence. He was -'Run! Run, Richard!' And he did run. He ran in huge, bounding leaps. He became a scaffold
against the looming sky. My hands flew up, flew over my head in a screaming, orlesque gesture, the fingers
reaching to the only familiar thing in this nightmare world - reaching to the clouds.

And the clouds answered. There was a huge, blue-white streak of lightning that seemed like the end of the world.
It struck Richard, it enveloped him. The last thing ~ remember is the electric stench of ozone and burnt flesh.

When I awoke I was sitting calmly on my porch, looking out towards the Big Dune. The storm had passed and
the air was pleasantly cool. There was a tiny sliver of moon. The sand was virginal - no sign of Richard or of the
dune buggy.

I looked down at my hands. The eyes were open but glazed. They had exhausted themselves. They dozed.

I knew well enough what had to be done. Before the door could be wedged open any further, it had to be locked.
For ever. Already I could notice the first signs of structural change in the hands themselves. The fingers were
begin-fling to shorten. . . and to change.

There was a small hearth in the living room, and in season I had been in the habit of lighting a fire against the
damp Florida cold. I lit one now, moving with haste. I had no idea when they might wake up to what I was doing.

When it was burning well I went out back to the kerosene drum and soaked both hands. They came awake

immediately, screaming with agony. I almost didn't make it back to the living room, and to the fire.

But I did make it.

That was all seven years ago. I'm still here, still watching the rockets take off. There have been more of them
lately. This is a space-minded administration. There has even been talk of another series of manned Venus probes.

I found out the boy's name, not that it matters. He was from the village, just as I thought. But his mother had
expected him to stay with a friend on the mainland that night, and the alarm was not raised until the following
Monday. Richard - well, everyone thought Richard was an odd duck, anyway. They suspect he may have gone
back to Maryland or taken up with some woman.

As for me, I'm tolerated, although I have quite a reputation for eccentricity myself. After all, how many ex-
astronauts regularly write their elected Washington officials with the idea that space-exploration money could be
better spent elsewhere?

I get along just fine with these hooks. There was terrible pain for the first year or so, but the human body can
adjust to almost anything. I shave with them and even tie my own shoelaces. And as you can see, my typing is
nice and even. I don't expect to have any trouble putting the shotgun into my mouth or pulling the trigger. It
started again three weeks ago, you see.

There is a perfect circle of twelve golden eyes on my chest.

 BATTLEGROUND

'Mr Renshaw?'

The desk clerk's voice caught him halfway to the elevator, and Renshaw turned back impatiently, shifting his
flight bag from one hand to the other. The envelope in his coat pocket, stuffed with twenties and fifties, crackled
heavily. The job had gone well and the pay had been excellent - even - after the Organization's 15 per cent
finder's fee had been skimmed off the top. Now all he wanted was a hot shower and a gin and tonic and sleep.

'What is it?'

'Package, sir. Would you sign the slip?'

Renshaw signed and looked thoughtfully at the rectangular package. His name and the building's address were
written on the gummed label in a spiky backhand script that seemed familiar. He rocked the package on the
imitation-marble surface of the desk, and something clanked faintly inside.

'Should I have that sent up, Mr Renshaw?'

'No, I've got it.' It was about eighteen inches on a side and fitted clumsily under his arm. He put it on the plush
carpet that covered the elevator floor and twisted his key in the penthouse slot above the regular rack of buttons.
The car rose smoothly and silently. He closed his eyes and let the job replay itself on the dark screen of his mind.

First, as always, a call from Cal Bates: 'You available, Johnny?'

He was available twice a year, minimum fee $10,000. He was very good, very reliable, but what his customers
really paid for was the infallible predator's talent. John Renshaw was a human hawk, constructed by both genetics
and environment to do two things superbly: kill and survive.

After Bates's call, a buff-coloured envelope appeared in Renshaw's box. A name, an address, a photograph. All
committed to memory; then down the garbage disposal with the ashes of envelope and contents.

This time the face had been that of a sallow Miami businessman named Hans Morris, founder and owner of the
Morris Toy Company. Someone had wanted Morris out of the way and had gone to the Organization. The
Organization, in the person of Calvin Bates, had talked to John Renshaw. Pow. Mourners please omit flowers.

The doors slid open, he picked up his package and stepped out. He unlocked the suite and stepped in. At this time
of day, just after 3p.m., the spacious living room was splashed with April sunshine. He paused for a moment,
enjoying it, then put the package on the end table by the door and loosened his tie. He dropped the envelope on
top of it and walked over to the terrace.

He pushed open the sliding glass door and stepped out. It was cold, and the wind knifed through his thin topcoat.
Yet he paused a moment, looking over the city the way a general might survey a captured country. Traffic
crawled beetlelike in the streets. Far away, almost buried in the golden afternoon haze, the Bay Bridge glittered
like a madman's mirage. To the east, all but lost behind the downtown high rises, the crammed and dirty
tenements with their stainless-steel forests of TV aerials. It was better up here. Better than in the gutters.

He went back inside, slid the door closed, and went into the bathroom for a long, hot shower.

When he sat down forty minutes later to regard his package, drink in hand, the shadows had marched halfway
across the wine-coloured carpet and the best of the afternoon was past.

It was a bomb.

Of course it wasn't, but one proceeded as if it were. That was why one had remained upright and taking
nourishment while so many others had gone to that great unemployment office in the sky.

If it was a bomb, it was clockless. It sat utterly silent; bland and enigmatic. Plastique was more likely these days,
anyway. Less temperamental than the clocksprings manufactured by Westclox and Big Ben.

Renshaw looked at the postmark. Miami, 15 April. Five days ago. So the bomb was not time-set. It would have
gone off in the hotel safe in that case.

Miami. Yes. And that spiky backhand writing. There had been a framed photograph on the sallow businessman's
desk. The photo had been of an even sallower old crone wearing a babushka. The script slanted across the bottom
had read: 'Best from your number-one idea girl - Mom.'

What kind of a number-one idea is this, Mom? A do-it-yourself extermination kit?

He regarded the package with complete concentration, not moving, his hands folded. Extraneous questions, such
as how Morris's number-one idea girl might - have discovered his address, did not occur to him. They were for
later, for Cal Bates. Unimportant now.

With a sudden, almost absent move, he took a small celluloid calendar out of his wallet and inserted it deftly
under the twine that crisscrossed the brown paper. He slid it under the Scotch tape that held one end flap. The
flap came loose, relaxing against the twine.

He paused for a time, observing, then leaned close and sniffed. Cardboard, paper, string. Nothing more. He
walked around the box, squatted easily on his haunches, and repeated the process. Twilight was invading his
apartment with grey, shadowy fingers.

One of the flaps popped free of the restraining twine, showing a dull green box beneath. Metal. Hinged. He
produced a pocket knife and cut the twine. It fell away, and a few helping prods with the tip of the knife revealed
the box.

It was green with black markings, and stenciled on the front in white letters were the words: G.I. JOE VIETNAM
FOOTLOCKER. Below that: 20 Infantrymen, 10 Helicopters, 2 BAR Men, 2 Bazooka Men, 2 Medics, 4 Jeeps.

Below that:

a flag decal. Below that, in the corner: Morris Toy Company, Miami, Fla.

He reached out to touch it, then withdrew his hand. Something inside the footlocker had moved.

Renshaw stood up, not hurrying, and backed across the room towards the kitchen and the hall. He snapped on the
lights.

The Vietnam Footlocker was rocking, making the brown paper beneath it rattle. It suddenly overbalanced and fell
to the carpet with a soft thud, landing on one end. The hinged top opened a crack of perhaps two inches.

Tiny foot soldiers, about an inch and a half tall, began to -crawl out. Renshaw watched them, unblinking. His
mind made no effort to cope with the real or unreal aspect of what he was seeing - only with the possible
consequences for his survival.

The soldiers were wearing minuscule army fatigues, helmets, and field packs. Tiny carbines were slung across
their shoulders. Two of them looked briefly across the room at Renshaw. Their eyes, no bigger than pencil points,
glittered.

Five, ten, twelve, then all twenty. One of them was gesturing, ordering the others. They lined themselves up -
along the crack that the fall had produced and began to push. The crack began to widen.

Renshaw picked one of the large pillows off the couch and began to walk towards them. The commanding officer
turned and gestured. The others whirled and unslung their carbines. There were tiny, almost delicate popping
sounds, and Renshaw felt suddenly as if he had been stung by bees.

He threw the pillow. It struck them, knocking them sprawling, then hit the box and knocked it wide open.
Insectlike, with a faint, high whirring noise like chiggers, a cloud of miniature helicopters, painted jungle green,
rose out of the box.

Tiny phut! phut! sounds reached Renshaw's ears and he saw pinprick-sized muzzle flashes coming from the open
copter doors. Needles pricked his belly, his right arm, the side of his neck. He clawed out and got one - sudden
pain in his fingers; blood welling. The whirling blades had chopped them to the bone in diagonal scarlet hash
marks. The others whirled out of range, circling him like horseflies. The stricken copter thumped to the rug and
lay still.

Sudden excruciating pain in his foot made him cry out. One of the foot soldiers was standing on his shoe and
bayoneting his ankle. The tiny face looked up, panting and grinning.

Renshaw kicked at it and the tiny body flew across the room to splatter on the wall. It did not leave blood but a
viscid purple smear.

There was a tiny, coughing explosion and blinding agony ripped his thigh. One of the bazooka men had come out
of the footlocker. A small curl of smoke rose lazily from his weapon. Renshaw looked down at his leg and saw a
blackened, smoking hole in his pants the size of a quarter. The flesh beneath was charred.

The little bastard shot me!

He turned and ran into the hall, then into his bedroom. One of the helicopters buzzed past his cheek, blades
whirring busily. The small stutter of a BAR. Then it darted away.

The gun beneath his pillow was a .44 Magnum, big enough to put a hole the size of two fists through anything it
hit. Renshaw turned, holding the pistol in both hands. He realized coolly that he would be shooting at a moving
target not much bigger than a flying light bulb.

Two of the copters whirred in. Sitting on the bed, Renshaw fired once. One of the helicopters exploded into
nothingness. That's two, he thought. He drew a bead on the second. . . squeezed the trigger .

It jigged! Goddamnit, it jigged!

The helicopter swooped at him in a sudden deadly arc, fore and aft overhead props whirring with blinding speed.
Renshaw caught a glimpse of one of the BAR men crouched at the open bay door, firing his weapon in short,
deadly bursts, and then he threw himself to the floor and rolled.

My eyes, the bastard was going for my eyes!

He came up on his back at the far wall, the gun held at chest level. But the copter was retreating. It seemed to
pause for a moment, and dip in recognition of Renshaw's superior firepower. Then it was gone, back towards the
living room.

Renshaw got up, wincing as his weight came down on the wounded leg. It was bleeding freely. And why not? he
thought grimly. It's not everybody who gets hit point-blank with a bazooka shell and lives to tell about it.

So Mom was his number-one idea girl, was she? She was all that and a bit more.

He shook a pillowcase free of the tick and ripped it into a bandage for his leg, then took his shaving mirror from
the bureau and went to the hallway door. Kneeling, he shoved it out on to the carpet at an angle and peered in.

They were bivouacking by the footlocker, damned if they weren't. Miniature soldiers ran hither and thither,
setting up tents. Jeeps two inches high raced about importantly. A medic was working over the soldier Renshaw
had kicked. The remaining eight copters flew in a protective swarm overhead, at coffee-table level.

Suddenly they became aware of the mirror, and three of the foot soldiers dropped to one knee and began firing.
Seconds later the mirror was shattered in four places. Okay, okay, then.

Renshaw went back to the bureau and got the heavy mahogany odds-and-ends box Linda had given him for
Christmas. He hefted it once, nodded, and went to the doorway and lunged through. He wound up and fired like 
pitcher throwing a fast ball. The box described a swift, true vector and smashed little men like ninepins. One of
the jeeps rolled over twice. Renshaw advanced to the doorway of the living room, sighted on one of the
sprawling soldiers, and gave it to him.

Several of the others had recovered. Some were kneeling and firing formally. Others had taken cover. Still others
had retreated back into the footlocker.

The bee stings began to pepper his legs and torso, but none reached higher than his rib cage. Perhaps the range
was too great. It didn't matter; he had no intention of being turned away. This was it.

He missed with his next shot - they were so goddamn small - but the following one sent another soldier into a
broken sprawl.

The copters were buzzing towards him ferociously. Now the tiny bullets began to splat into his face, above and
below his eyes. He potted the lead copter, then the second. Jagged streaks of pain silvered his vision.

The remaining six split into two retreating wings. His face was wet with blood and he swiped at it with his
forearm. He was ready to start firing again when he paused. The soldiers who had retreated inside the footlocker
were trundling something out. Something that looked like .

There was a blinding sizzle of yellow fire, and a sudden gout of wood and plaster exploded from the wall to his
left.

a rocket launcher!

He squeezed off one shot at it, missed, wheeled and ran for the bathroom at the far end of the corridor. He
slammed the door and locked it. In the bathroom mirror an Indian was staring back at him with dazed and
haunted eyes, a battle-crazed Indian with thin streamers of red paint drawn from holes no bigger than grains of
pepper. A ragged flap of skin dangled from one cheek. There was a gouged furrow in his neck.

I'm losing!

He ran a shaking hand through his hair. The front door was cut off. So was the phone and the kitchen extension.
They had a god-damn rocket launcher and a direct hit would tear his head off.

Damn it, that wasn't even listed on the box!

He started to draw in a long breath and let it out in a sudden grunt as a fist-sized section of the door blew in with
a charred burst of wood. Tiny flames glowed briefly around the ragged edges of the hole, and he saw the brilliant
flash as they launched another round. More wood blew inward, scattering burning slivers on the bathroom rug.
He stamped them out and two of the copters buzzed angrily through the hole. Minuscule BAR slugs stitched his
chest.

With a whining groan of rage he smashed one out of the air barehanded, sustaining a picket fence of deep slashes

across his palm. In sudden invention, he slung a heavy bath towel over the other. It fell, writhing to the floor, and
he stamped the life out of it. He breath was coming in hoarse whoops. Blood ran into one eye, hot and stinging,
and he wiped it away.

There, goddamnit. There. That'll make them think.

Indeed, it did seem to be making them think. There was no movement for fifteen minutes. Renshaw sat on the
edge of the tub, thinking feverishly. There had to be a way out of this blind alley. There had to be. If there was
only a way to flank them...

He suddenly turned and looked at the small window over the tub. There was a way. Of course there was.

His eyes dropped to the can of lighter fluid on top of the medicine cabinet. He was reaching for it when the
rustling noise came.

He whirled, bringing the Magnum up. . . but it was only a tiny scrap of paper shoved under the crack of the door.
The crack, Renshaw noted grimly, was too narrow for even one of them to get through.

There was one tiny word written on the paper:

Surrender

Renshaw smiled grimly and put the lighter fluid in his breast pocket. There was a chewed stub of pencil beside it.
He scrawled one word on the paper and shoved it back under the door. The word was:

NUTS

There was a sudden blinding barrage of rocket shells, and Renshaw backed away. They arched through the hole
in the door and detonated against the pale blue tiles above the towel rack, turning the elegant wall into a pocket
lunar landscape. Renshaw threw a hand over his eyes as plaster flew in a hot rain of shrapnel. Burning holes
ripped through his shirt and his back was peppered.

When the barrage stopped, Renshaw moved. He climbed on top of the tub and slid the window open. Cold stars
looked in at him. It was a narrow window, and a narrow ledge beyond it. But there was no time to think of that.

He boosted himself through, and the cold air slapped his lacerated face and neck like an open hand. He was
leaning over the balance points of his hands, staring straight down. Forty storeys down. From this height the
street looked no wider than a child's train track. The bright, winking lights of the city glittered madly below him
like thrown jewels.

With the deceptive ease of a trained gymnast, Renshaw brought his knees up to rest on the lower edge of the
window. If one of those wasp-sized copters flew through that hole in the door now, one shot in the ass would
send him straight down, screaming all the way.

None did.

He twisted, thrust one leg out, and one reaching hand grabbed the overhead cornice and held. A moment later he
was standing on the ledge outside the window.

Deliberately not thinking of the horrifying drop below his heels, not thinking of what would happen if one of the
helicopters buzzed out after him, Renshaw edged towards the corner of the building.

Fifteen feet . . . ten . There. He paused, he chest pressed against the wall, hands splayed out on the rough surface.
He could feel the lighter fluid in his breast pocket and the reassuring weight of the Magnum jammed in his
waistband.

Now to get around the goddamn corner.

Gently, he eased one foot around and slid his weight on to it. Now the right angle was pressed razorlike into his
chest and gut. There was a smear of bird guano in front of his eyes on the rough stone. Christ, he thought crazily.
I didn't know they could fly this high.

His left foot slipped.

For a weird, timeless moment he tottered over the brink, right arm back watering madly for balance, and then he
was clutching the two sides of the building in a lover's embrace, face pressed against the hard corner, breath
shuddering in and out of his lungs.

A bit at a time, he slid the other foot around.

Thirty feet away, his own living-room terrace jutted out.

He made his way down to it, breath sliding in and out of his lungs with shallow force. Twice he was forced to
stop as sharp gusts of wind tried to pick him off the ledge.

Then he was there, gripping the ornamented iron railings.

He hoisted himself over noiselessly. He had left the curtains half drawn across the sliding partition, and now he
peered in cautiously. They were just the way he wanted them - ass to.

Four soldiers and one copter had been left to guard the footlocker. The rest would be outside the bathroom door
with the rocket launcher.

Okay. In through the opening like gangbusters. Wipe out the ones by the footlocker, then out the door. Then a
quick taxi to the airport. Off to Miami to find Morris's number-one idea girl. He thought he might just burn her
face off with a flame thrower. That would be poetic justice.

He took off his shirt and ripped a long strip from one sleeve. He dropped the rest to flutter limply by his feet, and
bit off the plastic spout on the can of lighter fluid. He stuffed one end of the rag inside, withdrew it, and stuffed
the other end in so only a six-inch strip of saturated cotton hung free.

He got out his lighter, took a deep breath, and thumbed the wheel. He tipped it to the cloth and as it sprang alight
he. rammed open the glass partition and plunged through.

The copter reacted instantly, kamikaze-diving him as he charged across the rug, dripping tiny splatters of liquid
fire. Renshaw straight-armed it, hardly noticing the jolt of pain that ran up his arm as the turning blades chopped
his flesh open.

The tiny foot soldiers scattered into the footlocker.

After that, it all happened very rapidly.

Renshaw threw the lighter fluid. The can caught, mushrooming into a licking fireball. The next instant he was
reversing, running for the door.

He never knew what hit him.

It was like the thud that a steel safe would make when dropped from a respectable height. Only this thud ran
through the entire high-rise apartment building, thrumming in its steel frame like a tuning fork.

The penthouse door blew off its hinges and shattered against the far wall.

A couple who had been walking hand in hand below looked up in time to see a very large white flash, as though a
hundred flashguns had gone off at once.

'Somebody blew a fuse,' the man said. 'I guess -'What's that?' his girl asked.

Something was fluttering lazily down towards them; he caught it in one outstretched hand. 'Jesus, some guy's
shirt. All full of little holes. Bloody, too.'

'I don't like it,' she said nervously. 'Call a cab, huh, Ralph? We'll have to talk to the cops if something happened
up there, and I ain't supposed to be out with you.'

'Sure, yeah.'

He looked around, saw a taxi, and whistled. It's brake lights flared and they ran across to get it.

Behind them, unseen, a tiny scrap of paper floated down and landed near the remains of John Renshaw's shirt.
